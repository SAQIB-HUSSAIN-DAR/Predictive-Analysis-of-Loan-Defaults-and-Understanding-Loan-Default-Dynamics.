The project  highlights the some of the major factors  that will allow any company to  asses risk, gauge , financial stability and devising the targeted lending strategies. Where i have used python pandas to perform the EDA and visualization.

PROJECT FINDINGS AND DECISIONS:
1. Loan Default Statistics: Our analysis reveals that 25% of customers have a history of bad loans, while 75% have good loan histories. We will analyze various factors influencing loan repayment capabilities to improve our lending practices.

2. Grade-Based Risk Assessment: A strict evaluation of applicants' grades is crucial. Customers with grades E, C, and D are at higher risk of default, while those with grade A are less likely to default. We will implement preventive measures, such as stricter approval criteria and customized risk mitigation strategies, for higher-risk grades.

3. Home Ownership Insight:
Mortgage Holders: More likely to apply for loans.
Renters: Moderate application rate.
Homeowners: Least likely to apply for loans.
This information will help us create tailored loan offers for each category, enhancing customer satisfaction and loan performance.

4.Higher Risk for Renters: With a 23% default rate, renters represent the highest credit risk. To mitigate this:
Implement stricter credit checks and require additional collateral.
Develop tailored loan products with shorter terms or higher down payments.
Offer incentives for mortgage holders, like lower interest rates or reduced fees, to attract low-risk borrowers.
Use risk-based pricing models to adjust interest rates based on default risk.
Adjust loan approval criteria for renters, such as stricter income-to-debt ratios or higher credit score requirements.

5. Income and Default Risk: As annual income increases, the risk of loan default decreases. This insight allows us to offer tailored interest rates for higher-income borrowers, incentivizing timely repayments and reducing default rates.
Loan Term Preferences for Debt Consolidation and Credit Cards: Borrowers in the credit card and debt-consolidation categories prefer loan terms of 36 months and 60 months. Understanding these preferences enables us to:
Tailor loan products and marketing strategies to meet the specific needs of these borrowers.
Provide financial education and debt management resources to help borrowers make informed decisions, improving financial outcomes for both borrowers and lenders.
Conclusion: By leveraging these insights, we can enhance our risk assessment, financial stability indicators, and targeted lending strategies, leading to refined customer selection and reduced losses for the company.
